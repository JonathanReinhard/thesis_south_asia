# Terrorism in South Asia

Some basic information up front. The dataset I am using is from Kaggle. It is from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) which is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. It is maintained and expanded by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). You can find out more about their work and methodology on their [website](http://start.umd.edu/gtd/).

### What is your motivation to look into Terrorism and why with focus on South Asia of all places?

Unfortunately terrorism seems to be one of the defining phenomenons of our time. And I don't necessarily mean actual terrorist blowing something up in your neighborhood but the way it shapes our societies and is increasingly contributing to the erosion of civil rights among all western democracies. Although other nations adopt similar strategies and security measures to protect themselves from terrorist attacks.

In light of these developments I think it is of paramount importance to collect all available data regarding terrorism and thoroughly investigate not only the organizations involved or the impact that their actions have but also to identify common motives for radicalization and terrorist acts.

So why South Asia? For one, because the dataset is huge and provides an incredible amount of raw data about terrorism of the last 46 years. While it is recommendable to take on all that information I thought a case study for one area would probably be more beneficial as it would enable a more detail focused approach. South Area as region of interest is pretty self explanatory once the aforementioned assumption has been taken. As a region it experienced terrorism from a fairly early time, with Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka being the battleground for a wide variety of interest groups with opposing ideas and the determination to take extreme actions to further their goals. Additionally it was a field of study during my time at University and appreciated the chance to dive into the region and subject again.

### Questions?

Although I have hinted at some of the potential questions that arise from the dataset and the underlying topic, I want to articulate some more detailed  questions here:

1. Terrorist attacks have been an important part of pushing group agendas to the news headlines and into the public discourse. Can we identify a correlation between terrorist incidents and political/cultural events in the respective countries and what shape do these acts take?
2. While some terrorist groups may share a similar agenda, does this translate to the means they use to achieve their goals? How can similarities or discrepancies be explained?
3. While we experience an increase in terrorist attacks throughout the world, can that be said for all regions with terrorist activities or are there differences? If there are differences how can they be explained and if not what conclusions can be drawn from the years of monitoring these incidents?
4. TBC.
