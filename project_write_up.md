# Terrorism in South Asia

Some basic information up front. The dataset I am using is from Kaggle. It is from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) which is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. It is maintained and expanded by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). You can find out more about their work and methodology on their [website](http://start.umd.edu/gtd/).

### What is your motivation to look into Terrorism and why with focus on South Asia of all places?

Unfortunately terrorism seems to be one of the defining phenomenons of our time. And I don't necessarily mean actual terrorist blowing something up in your neighborhood but the way it shapes our societies and is increasingly contributing to the erosion of civil rights among all western democracies. Although other nations adopt similar strategies and security measures to protect themselves from terrorist attacks.

In light of these developments I think it is of paramount importance to collect all available data regarding terrorism and thoroughly investigate not only the organizations involved or the impact that their actions have but also to identify common motives for radicalization and terrorist acts.

So why South Asia? For one, because the dataset is huge and provides an incredible amount of raw data about terrorism of the last 46 years. While it is recommendable to take on all that information I thought a case study for one area would probably be more beneficial as it would enable a more detail focused approach. South Area as region of interest is pretty self explanatory once the aforementioned assumption has been taken. As a region it experienced terrorism from a fairly early time, with Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka being the battleground for a wide variety of interest groups with opposing ideas and the determination to take extreme actions to further their goals. Additionally it was a field of study during my time at University and appreciated the chance to dive into the region and subject again.


### Definition of Terrorism?

The GTD database uses the following definition of a terrorist attack:

The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present:

The incident must be intentional â€“ the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.
The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.
The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.

In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:

Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.
Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.
Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants).

### Questions?

Although I have hinted at some of the potential questions that arise from the dataset and the underlying topic, I want to articulate some more detailed  questions here:

1. Terrorist attacks have been an important part of pushing group agendas to the news headlines and into the public discourse. Can we identify a correlation between terrorist incidents and political/cultural events in the respective countries and what shape do these acts take?
2. While some terrorist groups may share a similar agenda, does this translate to the means they use to achieve their goals? How can similarities or discrepancies be explained?
3. While we experience an increase in terrorist attacks throughout the world, can that be said for all regions with terrorist activities or are there differences? If there are differences how can they be explained and if not what conclusions can be drawn from the years of monitoring these incidents?
4. TBC.
